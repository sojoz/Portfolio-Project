            <h3> Patisserie Project</h3>
            <p class="project-info text-muted">
              This is the first project that I ever did through coding. In this you can see how I am still experimenting with margins and padding. I learned how to use CSS, HTML and some javascript. For this 
              project, I was meant to create a landing page for something that I enjoy and I had to go for pastries! I also had fun writing the content myself.
              I was able to create a basic web page for a 4 week course. At the bottom of the page, there are links to various pages with information on different pastries. 
              There is also a button which allows the user to take a quiz, through alerts, to find out which pastry they are based on some questions!</p>

           <h3> Weather app </h3>
          <p class="project-info text-muted"> In this project, I built a Vanilla Javascript weather app. I really enjoyed the challenge of implementing the API, as well as experimenting with SVG files.
            I created this weather app using CSS, Javascript, HTML and Bootstap. The course allowed to to experience real-life development workflow & hosting. This weather app allowes the user to find the current weather, as well as a forecast
            of any city of their choosing. There is also a function that allows the user to select their current location.

            <h3> Timezone app</h3>
            <p class="project-info timezone-info text-muted">
              For this project, I had to create a Timezone app that displays the current times in various cities. The user can also select a dropdown menu and select the timezone of a different city than the ones already on display. Also included
              in the dropdown menu is the option to select the users current location/time. After the weather app, i was pretty comfortable using the API's, and I focused on the design element. To create this app, I used the same tools as my previous projects,
              as well as the Moment timezone's javascript library.
